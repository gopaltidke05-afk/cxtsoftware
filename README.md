# CXT Automation Framework

## Automation Skills (AI-Assisted)

I do not have deep theoretical knowledge of all automation tools and languages.  
I mainly work in a **practical way** by using **AI assistance** to create and execute automation scripts.

### What I Can Do
- Use AI to understand automation requirements
- Generate and customize automation scripts
- Build basic automation frameworks
- Execute and validate automated test cases

### Tools & Languages (AI-Assisted)
- Selenium with Java
- Playwright (JavaScript / TypeScript)
- Cypress (JavaScript)
- Appium (Mobile Automation)
- Automation using Python and C# (with AI support)

### Important Note
I rely on **AI and documentation** to perform automation tasks.  
My strength is **hands-on execution and problem solving**, not theoretical explanation of tools.

I am transparent about my skill level and continuously learning while working on real automation tasks.
